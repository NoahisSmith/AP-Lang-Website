How to open:

Step One- left click on index.html once

Step Two- after it is selected right click and open with Internet Explorer and click allow 
content if prompted :)

--------------------------------

I would have included videos and hosted it on an actual web server but the debugging proccess was alot 
longer then I expected...

I had alot of fun making this though, hopefully everthing works okay!
