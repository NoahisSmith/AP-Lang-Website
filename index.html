						<h2>The author's message</h2>
						<p>The author of Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury, warns the audience of the dangers of censorship. This society heavily consumes pills, drugs, media, drive fast and recklessly and live faced paced lives. Bradbury shows that a society with too much stimulation doesn't have enough time to stop and think. This allows for a society to believe books are too overwhelming of a task to stop and think about. This also allows individuals to envy others with greater knowledge and become hostile towards them. A society of this nature mask their self-hatred and sadness with instant gratification and harmful pleasures. Through these examples, Bradbury warns us of the dangers of censorship.
